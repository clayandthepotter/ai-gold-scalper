# Data Flow and AI Signal Processing

## Overview

This document explains the complete data flow and trade signal processing within the AI Gold Scalper system, emphasizing the role of MQ5 server files, the Expert Advisor (EA), and the AI server.

## üóÇ MQ5 Server Files Integration

### ML Integration (`ml_integration.mq5`)
- **Purpose**: Collects features from market data, price, technical indicators, and more.
- **Functionality**: Converts these features into a JSON structure for AI analysis.

### Performance Analytics (`performance_analytics.mq5`)
- **Purpose**: Monitors key trading metrics such as win/loss rates, drawdown, etc.
- **Functionality**: Continuous evaluation for effective trade performance monitoring.

### Adaptive Learning (`adaptive_learning_engine.mq5`)
- **Purpose**: Conducts trade performance analysis to adjust strategy parameters.
- **Functionality**: Refines strategies over time for improved outcomes.

## üîÄ EA Components and Data Flow

- The EA integrates server files to collect extensive market data and perform real-time analysis.
- Market data, including technical indicators like RSI, MACD, ATR, etc., is prepared and sent to the AI server via HTTP POST requests.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI Server Processing

### Market Data Reception
- **Endpoint**: `/ai_signal`
- **Process**: Receives updated market data from the EA.

### Signal Fusion
- Combines signals from multiple sources: ML models, technical analysis, and GPT-4.

### Model Inference
- **Prediction**: Utilizes ML models to forecast market movements.
- **Features**: Engineers complex features for model consumption.

### GPT-4 Analysis
- Provides sentiment analysis and market insights.

### Technical Analysis
- Generates signals based on market conditions and technical indicators.

### Risk Management
- Adjusts stop-loss/take-profit levels based on confidence levels and market analysis.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Trade Execution

- The AI server returns the final trade signal to the EA, which then executes trades aligned with these signals.
- Depending on the mode (e.g., `MODE_FULL_AUTO`), trades can be automated or signals can guide manual execution.

## üìä Data Usage for Model Training

- **Feature Engineering**: Continually collects historical market data to train ML models.
- **Feedback Loop**: The adaptive learning engine ensures model performance improves over time, leading to better predictions and trade outcomes.
